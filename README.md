Professional Self-Assessment
The completion of my coursework in the Computer Science program and the development of my ePortfolio have been instrumental in refining my technical expertise, solidifying my professional goals, and preparing me to be a competitive candidate in the field. Through hands-on projects, collaboration, and the application of computer science principles, I have built a strong foundation in software development, security, and problem-solving. This ePortfolio serves as a curated representation of my capabilities, demonstrating my ability to develop full-stack applications, engineer secure and efficient software solutions, and apply reverse engineering techniques for software analysis.

Showcasing My Strengths & Professional Growth
Throughout the program, I have worked on diverse projects that challenged me to think critically and strategically. Developing the Traveler Website reinforced my ability to design scalable web applications, manage databases efficiently, and implement robust authentication mechanisms. Meanwhile, building an Android Application allowed me to deepen my understanding of mobile development, user interface design, and cloud-based backend integrations. Additionally, my work on Reverse Engineering Code tested my analytical skills, requiring me to dissect compiled binaries, identify vulnerabilities, and strengthen my understanding of cybersecurity principles.

Beyond the technical aspects, these projects also helped me enhance my soft skills, such as collaboration, communication, and problem-solving. Whether working in a team or independently, I learned to balance technical requirements with user needs, ensuring that the software I developed was both functional and secure.

Technical Skills & Competencies
Collaborating in a Team Environment: Throughout the program, I engaged in collaborative development, practicing version control using Git and GitHub, participating in Agile workflows, and leveraging peer feedback to improve my work. Developing the Traveler Website, for instance, required working with both frontend and backend technologies while maintaining clean and maintainable code.

Communicating with Stakeholders: Clear and effective communication is critical in software development. By documenting my code, creating technical reports, and presenting my work, I have honed my ability to convey complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. The Android application project required detailed documentation, ensuring that future developers or clients could seamlessly understand and extend the application.

Data Structures & Algorithms: Implementing efficient data structures and algorithms has been a recurring theme in my projects. The Reverse Engineering Code project particularly highlighted my ability to analyze code behavior, optimize performance, and understand how underlying algorithms function within compiled binaries.

Software Engineering & Databases: I have developed full-stack applications, integrating front-end frameworks with backend databases. My Traveler Website showcases my ability to implement RESTful APIs, manage SQL databases, and ensure smooth user experiences through thoughtful UI/UX design.

Security & Reverse Engineering: Security is an essential aspect of modern software development. My work on Reverse Engineering strengthened my understanding of vulnerability detection, while my experience developing secure login systems in the Traveler Website demonstrated my ability to protect user data. Additionally, my coursework covered topics such as encryption, secure coding practices, and penetration testing methodologies.
